# Account.java Explanation

This file defines the `Account` entity class, which represents financial accounts in the Finwise application. Let me break it down:

## Class Purpose
The `Account` class maps to the `accounts` table in the database and represents different types of financial accounts a user might have (savings accounts, credit cards, investments, etc.).

## Key Annotations
- **`@Entity`**: Marks this class as a JPA entity to be persisted in the database
- **`@Table(name = "accounts")`**: Maps to the "accounts" table in the database
- **Lombok annotations**:
  - `@Data`: Generates getters, setters, equals/hashCode, and toString methods
  - `@Builder`: Enables the builder pattern for creating Account instances
  - `@NoArgsConstructor`/`@AllArgsConstructor`: Generates constructors
- **`@EntityListeners`**: Enables automatic date tracking for creation/modification

## Important Fields
1. **`id`**: Primary key with auto-increment
2. **`user`**: Many-to-one relationship with the User entity (each account belongs to one user)
3. **`accountName`**: Required name of the account (e.g., "HDFC Savings")
4. **`accountType`**: Type of account (from the AccountType enum)
5. **`institution`**: Financial institution (e.g., "HDFC Bank")
6. **`currentBalance`**: Current balance with default of 0
7. **`availableBalance`**: Available balance (may differ from current for credit cards)
8. **`accountNumber`**: Account number at the institution
9. **`lastUpdated`**, **`active`**, **`notes`**: Additional metadata
10. **`createdDate`**, **`modifiedDate`**: Audit fields automatically managed

## Relationships
- **User relationship**: `@ManyToOne` - Many accounts can belong to one user
- **Transaction relationship**: `@OneToMany` - One account can have many transactions
  - `cascade = CascadeType.ALL` means operations on Account cascade to related Transactions
  - `orphanRemoval = true` means transactions removed from the collection will be deleted

## India-Specific Account Types
The `AccountType` enum includes standard types like SAVINGS and CREDIT_CARD, but also India-specific investment vehicles:
- **FD**: Fixed Deposit
- **PPF**: Public Provident Fund
- **EPF**: Employee Provident Fund
- **NPS**: National Pension System

This entity forms a core part of the financial data model, connecting users to their transactions and providing the structure to track various financial accounts in a way that's customized for Indian users.
