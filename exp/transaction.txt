# Transaction Model Explanation

## Overview
The Transaction class is a core data model in the FinWise application that represents financial transactions. It's implemented as a JPA Entity that maps to the "transactions" table in the database.

## Technical Implementation
- Uses JPA (Jakarta Persistence API) for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- Leverages Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate code (@Data, @Builder, etc.)
- Implements auditing with EntityListeners to track creation/modification timestamps
- Uses proper relationships with other entities (Account, Category)

## Key Fields
1. `id`: Primary key with auto-generated value
2. `account`: The financial account associated with this transaction (Many-to-one)
3. `transactionDate`: Date and time when the transaction occurred
4. `amount`: Monetary value of the transaction (using BigDecimal for precision)
5. `description`: Text description of the transaction
6. `merchantName`: Name of the merchant or vendor
7. `category`: Financial category for the transaction (Many-to-one)
8. `reconciled`: Boolean flag indicating if the transaction has been verified/reconciled
9. `transactionType`: Enum with three possible values:
   - EXPENSE: Money going out
   - INCOME: Money coming in
   - TRANSFER: Money moving between accounts
10. `notes`: Additional free-form text notes about the transaction
11. `createdDate`: Automatically tracked timestamp of when the record was created
12. `modifiedDate`: Automatically updated timestamp of when the record was last modified
13. `attachments`: Associated files/receipts (One-to-many relationship)

## Database Relationships
- Each transaction belongs to one Account
- Each transaction belongs to one Category (optional)
- A transaction can have multiple attachments

## Usage in the Application
This model supports core functionality including:
- Recording all financial activities
- Tracking expenses and income
- Categorizing spending for budget analysis
- Attaching receipts and documentation
- Supporting reporting and analytical features

The Transaction entity is central to the application's ability to track financial activity and provide meaningful insights into spending patterns and financial health.
